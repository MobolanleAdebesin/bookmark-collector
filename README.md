## Use 
1. pipenv install 
2. pipenv run python lib/bookmarks.py

## Future Directions 
This was my first attempt at building a python application in the command line. I would love to improve the layout/user interface of the GUI. Currently the GUI is on a separate branch from the master branch because the code for the application is so different between the branches. 

I'm most proud of figuring out how to use tkinter because I was able to build this GUI in less than 24 hours with no prior experience. 

## Issues 
If you find any issues or have suggestions on ways I can improve this application pleas submit them [here](https://github.com/MobolanleAdebesin/bookmark-collector/issues)
